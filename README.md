Welcome to **ChainGuess**, a simple and beginner-friendly **Solidity smart contract** game built on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.  
Players can guess a random number, test their luck, and win double their bet if they guess correctly.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: This version uses pseudo-randomness (not fully secure). A Chainlink VRF version can be added later for true provable fairness.*

## üß† Project Description

**ChainGuess** is a decentralized number guessing game designed to help beginners learn how to:
- Build smart contracts using **Solidity**.
- Deploy on the **Celo blockchain**.
- Interact with on-chain events and ETH-based rewards.
  
The goal is to create a fun, transparent, and educational blockchain mini-game that showcases basic **Solidity concepts** like state variables, events, and randomness.

---

## üí° What It Does

1. Players send a small amount of **ETH (or CELO)** along with their guess (between 1 and 10).  
2. The contract generates a **random winning number** using on-chain data.  
3. If the player guesses correctly, they **win double** their bet!  
4. Game results are recorded as **events** on-chain for transparency.

## ‚ú® Features

- üé≤ **Number Guessing Game:** Guess a number between 1 and 10.  
- üí∞ **Double Reward:** Win 2x your bet if you guess correctly.  
- üìú **Transparent Results:** Every game emits an event with results.  
- üîê **Owner Controls:** The contract owner can fund and withdraw balance.  
- üß± **Celo Sepolia Deployment:** Fully deployed and testable on the Celo network.
